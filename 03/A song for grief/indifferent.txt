Throwback to how I used to care about
Where you went, where you've been, who you're with
Losin' my patience and checkin' locations
And rereadin' texts that you sent

I would cry, one, two, three too many times
Just wastin' my prime on a guy who was more wrong than right

Now I don't even know what I'm missin'
Don't care what it is or it isn't
Don't need your attention (no), or your time
They say, "Did you hear?" I say, "No thanks, I'm fine"
I think I could wish you the best
The truth is I couldn't care less
How sweet it is to be so (so), so indifferent

June came and went, when's your birthday again?
Did I miss it? My bad, that's on me
I see your truck and I don't give a-
And it don't make my heart skip a beat

I like not wonderin' where you are tonight
It feels so nice finally being on the other side

Now I don't even know what I'm missin'
Don't care what it is or it isn't
Don't need your attention (no), or your time
They say, "Did you hear?" I say, "No thanks, I'm fine"
I think I could wish you the best
The truth is I couldn't care less
How sweet it is to be so (so), so indifferent

I'm indifferent, I'm just livin'
When your mama calls, I'm reminded you exist
And I wish that she didn't
'Cause all my "give-a-damns", they've already been given

Now I don't even know what I'm missin'
Don't care what it is or it isn't
Don't need your attention (no), or your time
They say, "Did you hear?" I say, "No thanks, I'm fine" (no thanks, I'm fine)
I think I could wish you the best
The truth is I couldn't care less (couldn't care less)
How sweet it is to be so (so), so indifferent
